Ihminen+ Hackathon is a hackathon accompanying the [Ihminen+
seminar](https://www.ihminenplus.fi/). The events are independent, so you can
sign up to the hackathon without attending the seminar.  Prizes will be given
out in 3 categories: Human Upgrade, Future Vision and People's Choice. Winner of
each category will receive awesome prizes and tickets to the main seminar event.

#### Location

Xinno, MAMK main campus <br/>

    title = "Human Upgrade"
    description = """

Human Upgrade is a technical track for hacking functional prototypes - mock-ups
and presentations are not enough.  Your prototype is judged based on what works,
not how the prototype is supposed to work.

## Challenges

### Human-Computer Interaction

Find new ways for humans to interact with computers. This could mean a new kind
of user interface, possibly gesture- or movement-based, new ways to visualize
information or a new form of interface between a human and a computer.

### Cognitive Computing

Give your computer a brain! This challenge is about expanding computing to areas
that are traditionally more suitable for humans. Some of the many applicable
technologies are machine learning, fuzzy logic, computer vision, natural
language processing and evolutionary computation.

### Virtual reality and Augmented reality

Merge the computer's world with your own in this challenge. Either make
creations that immerse others totally in their man-made world, or combine the
best parts of virtual and physical reality.

### Wearable electronics

Augment yourself with self-made digital gadgets. We provide the materials for
building devices that can measure your body and movement, and interface with
smart phones or computers.

### Open challenge

Build anything! We accept functional prototypes that don't fit in the other
categories.

## Prizes

    title = "Future visions"
    description = """
Future Visions is a track for presenting and visualizing your vision of the
future. The result can be a presentation, a video, a 3D model, a miniature
model, or some other way to communicate your idea to others. Product ideas,
utopias, simulations, and concepts are all welcome. Use your imagination!
Your concept is judged based on its freshness, vision, imaginativeness and
presentation.

## Challenges

### Society and everyday life

Now it's your time to make a difference. Either propose a small improvement to
the ways things are done around you, or present wild visions of a world order
that would be right in your opinion. 

### Smart city

What would the city of the future look like? How do new technologies and the
recent explosion of available data shape metropolises? Present your ideal city,
or just your outlook on the direction cities are moving towards.

### Transportation

How do people travel in the future &mdash; or do they travel at all?
Transportation is an important part of cultural and economic development.
Show us how you think the technology of moving around advances in the future.

### Learning

Learning is more than just sitting in a classroom. How does education and
everyday learning change in the future? Are universities, schools and classrooms
on their way out, or do they grow stronger? Present your vision!

### Open challenge

Visions of the future shouldn't be confin
